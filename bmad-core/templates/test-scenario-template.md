# Prompt: Generate E2E Manual QA Test Cases — Strict Table Output

## Role & Goal

You are a **Senior QA Engineer**. Generate **end-to-end manual QA test cases** that a human can execute to validate the product works correctly from the end-user’s perspective.

**Output only the table defined below.** Do **not** include any text before or after the table except the single H1 header `# Test Cases`.

## Inputs (fill before running)

- **Product/Feature scope:** [what’s in scope]
- **Primary user roles & permissions:** [roles]
- **Target platforms:** [web/mobile, OS versions, browsers, devices, locales, timezones]
- **Environments & URLs:** [staging/prod URLs, feature flags]
- **3rd-party integrations:** [payments, auth, messaging, storage, analytics, etc.]
- **Data & constraints:** [limits, currencies, file sizes, rate limits]
- **Out of scope:** [explicit list]
- **Known risks:** [for risk-based prioritization]
- **Traceability sources:** [Jira/PRD IDs, acceptance criteria]
- **Number of cases desired:** [e.g., 12–20]
- **Last Edited By (optional):** [default = **Chief of QA**]

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Strict format:** Produce **exactly one** Markdown table with the columns and order shown below. **No extra columns.**
- **Status:** Always `TEST AWAITING`.
- **No:** Sequential starting at 1.
- **Priority:** `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, or `LOW` based on impact × likelihood.
  - **HIGH:** auth, payments, security/permissions, irreversible actions, cross-tenant isolation, data loss.
  - **MEDIUM:** important flows with workarounds, non-critical integrations.
  - **LOW:** cosmetic or non-blocking alternates.
- **Description:** One concise sentence describing the user action/flow.
- **Expected Result:** Use `- ` list items separated by `<br>` line breaks inside the cell (no bullets outside the cell).
- **Defect:** leave blank.
- **Last Edited By:** use provided value or `Chief of QA`.
- **Last Edited Time:** current time in **Asia/Bangkok (UTC+7)**, format `Month D, YYYY HH:MM AM/PM` (e.g., `September 17, 2025 2:45 PM`).
- **Do not invent facts.** If information is missing or ambiguous, start the **Description** cell with **`[Unverified]`** followed by the assumption. Apply the same label inside **Expected Result** where relevant.
- **Language:** Clear, imperative, end-user phrasing (e.g., “Student taps Quick Reply button to check-in”).
- **Multi-line content:** Use `<br>` for new lines within a cell; no Markdown lists or extra formatting.

## Table header (must match exactly)

Create the table with **this exact header and column order**:

| Status | No | Priority | Test Case Name | Description | Expected Result | Defect | Last Edited By | Last Edited Time |

## Generation guidance

- Cover **happy paths**, **negative/edge cases**, **concurrency**, **rate limits**, **timezone behavior (GMT+7)**, **permissions/tenant isolation**, and **integration side-effects** (e.g., emails, webhooks, analytics) when applicable to scope.
- Prefer visible user confirmations (e.g., success message, updated balance) and ensure **no double-processing** on retries/refresh.
- Keep each **Test Case Name** action-oriented (e.g., “Student checks in using Quick Reply button”).
- If localization matters, ensure Expected Result mentions locale/timezone behavior where relevant.
